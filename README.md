# An Analysis of Boba Yelp Reviews
## About Violet and Gloria's MSA 2024 Fall Side Project
Hi, welcome to our statistical side project. Our names are Violet Evans and Gloria Su, and the inspiration behind our side project came from our love for bubble tea. Bubble tea, also known as boba, is a sweet Taiwanese drink that has grown in popularity across the world.  As Asian Americans growing up in North Carolina, we often craved Asian cuisines in the Triangle that reminded us of our heritage. Growing up, boba culture wasn't large. However, the popularity of boba in the wider Raleigh area has grown alongside the wider Raleigh area of nearly 40,000 households and businesses between 2018 and 2022, bringing large quantities of cute and trendy Asian boba shops.  A boba subculture began to rise in young Asian Americans just as we started undergrad at UNC in 2019, and we began largely consuming boba as avid fans ever since. 


## Fall Project Documentation
For our statistical side project, we provided a comprehensive study on boba shop Yelp reviews from Raleigh, North Carolina, and New York City, New York, in a quest to determine what makes the highest rated shops.

We performed the following: 
- Requested developer access to Yelp API with an application.
- Chose Yelp API parameters for the type of review and location.
- Used longitude/latitude information in Tableau.
- Presented our statistical findings on October 30th, 2023 at the Institute for Advanced Analytics.
I hope you enjoy reading about our work!
